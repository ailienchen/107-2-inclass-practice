```{r}
aLogical <- c(T,TRUE,F,FALSE,FALSE)
class(aLogical)
```


```{r}
x3 <- c("小明","小花")
y3 <- c("小明","小華")
```

```{r}
x3==y3
x3!=y3
```
!negation
```{r}
x3==y3
!(x3==y3)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
exData2 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/github-data/master/exData2.csv")
currency <- exData2$幣別
```

```{r}
head(currency)#head會顯示物件前六個元素直
```

資料一進來並沒有被當成factor class

```{r}
class(currency)
```
更正為factor class

```{r}
currency <-as.factor(currency)
class(currency)
```

```{r}
levels(currency)
```

length():數向量內的元素個素(向量的長度)
```{r}
length(levels(currency))
```

```{r}
step1_extractLevelsVector<- levels(currency)
step1_extractLevelsVector
```

```{r}
step2_countVectorLength<-length(step1_extractLevelsVector)
```

```{r}
step2_countVectorLength
```

多少比日圓資料?

```{r}
head(currency)
levels(currency)
```

```{r}
currency2<- c("日元","美元","日元")
currency2
```

```{r}
sum(currency2=="日元")
```
```{r}
head(currency)
sum(currency=="日圓JPY/USD")
```


































```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
